# glucose
analysis of glucose data got from a dexcom device
basic ideea starts from the pattern recognition that could work on large amount of data in glucose patterns
the script searches for ways to divide the graph into sections and later to analyze those
at the moment it just divides the values into the sub unit i called ripple- basically a sine with maximum and minimum value/interval

should be noted it has a lot of imports
